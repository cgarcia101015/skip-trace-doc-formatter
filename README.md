This application will take in an excel spreadsheet, format it to only contain the appropriate data releavant to skip trace applications, then return the formatted copy as a csv file. 

Once the CSV file is skip traced, this application can upload that file and consolidate and match the data onto a copy of the original excel spreadsheet.
